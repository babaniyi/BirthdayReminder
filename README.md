# BirthdayReminder
I have a habit of forgetting dates especially birthdays and this has inadvertently cost me some friendships. My younger sisterâ€™s birthday is November 22, to prove i care (in all honesty i do), I decided to use my skills as a data scientist to write a function in Python that automatically reminds me of her birthday and send her birthday wishes at 10am.
